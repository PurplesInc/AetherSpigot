This is the latest version as of July 4, 2025. It was open-sourced to support the community by providing insight into what happens behind the scenes.
There’s a lot of amazing stuff packed into it, so it’s definitely worth looking into if you’re interested in how things work under the hood

Our changes start with "AetherSpigot start" and end with "AetherSpigot end"

Some components have been removed due to licensing restrictions from the original authors. We were using a few patches from [Beaness](https://github.com/beaness), and around 40% of our custom patches were implemented with his help. Since those patches also exist in AzuriteSpigot, we chose not to expose any of their proprietary work.

### Credits:

If you plan to use this for your own server, you must credit the Arcuno Network’s Development Team. Failure to do so may result in appropriate action being taken.
Credits go to mqaaz for discovering dynamic friction and sharing the information with us. This allowed us to implement it successfully, and servers like Roselia and Arcuno still use the same knockback system to this day though Arcuno’s knockback was recently recoded and it uses a entirely different concept.
